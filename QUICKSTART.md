# ⚡ QUICK START GUIDE

**Everything you need to get your app running with the new update system!**

---

## 🎯 STEP 1: Install New Packages (2 minutes)

Open your terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

This will install:
- ✅ r_upgrade (update system)
- ✅ package_info_plus (version checking)
- ✅ path_provider (file management)
- ✅ dio (downloads)

**Expected output:**
```
Running "flutter pub get" in khair_ul_madaaris_library...
Resolving dependencies...
Got dependencies!
```

---

## 🎯 STEP 2: Test Your App (1 minute)

Run your app to make sure everything still works:

```bash
flutter run
```

**What should happen:**
- ✅ App opens normally
- ✅ All features work (nothing broke!)
- ✅ No crashes
- ✅ Update check runs in background (but finds nothing since GitHub not set up yet)

**Note:** Update dialog won't appear yet because:
1. GitHub repository doesn't exist yet
2. version.json URL isn't configured yet

---

## 🎯 STEP 3: Set Up GitHub (15 minutes)

**Follow the detailed guide:**
Open `GITHUB_SETUP_GUIDE.md` and follow ALL steps.

**Quick summary:**
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Upload your code
3. Build release APK
4. Create GitHub Release
5. Update version.json with download URL
6. Update code with your GitHub username

**Critical:** You MUST replace `YOUR_USERNAME` in the code!

**File to edit:**
`lib/services/app_update_service.dart` - Line 17

**Change this:**
```dart
static const String _versionCheckUrl =
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/khair_ul_madaaris_library/main/version.json';
```

**To this (example for username "john_doe"):**
```dart
static const String _versionCheckUrl =
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/john_doe/khair_ul_madaaris_library/main/version.json';
```

---

## 🎯 STEP 4: Test Update System (10 minutes)

### Test #1: Manual Check

1. Open your app
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Scroll to **About** section
4. Tap **"Check for Updates"**

**Expected result:**
- If no GitHub setup yet: Error message (normal!)
- If GitHub setup correct: "You're up to date" message

### Test #2: Automatic Check

1. Close and reopen app
2. Wait 2-3 seconds on home screen
3. If update available: Dialog should appear automatically

---

## 🎯 STEP 5: Release Your First Update (10 minutes)

When you want to push an update:

### A. Update Version Number

**Edit `pubspec.yaml` line 5:**
```yaml
# Before
version: 1.0.0+1

# After (example)
version: 1.0.1+2
```

**Rule:** Increment BOTH numbers:
- `1.0.0` → `1.0.1` (version name)
- `+1` → `+2` (version code - MUST be higher!)

### B. Build New APK

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

**APK location:**
`build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

### C. Create GitHub Release

1. Go to your repository
2. Click "Releases"
3. Click "Create a new release"
4. Tag: `v1.0.1`
5. Upload APK
6. Publish

### D. Update version.json

**Edit `version.json` in your project:**

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "versionCode": 2,
  "releaseDate": "2025-10-30",
  "downloadUrl": "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/khair_ul_madaaris_library/releases/download/v1.0.1/app-release.apk",
  "fileSize": "40 MB",
  "mandatory": true,
  "changelog": [
    "🐛 Fixed bugs",
    "⚡ Performance improvements",
    "✨ New features"
  ]
}
```

**Push to GitHub:**
```bash
git add version.json pubspec.yaml
git commit -m "Release v1.0.1"
git push
```

### E. Test Update

1. Open app (old version still installed)
2. Wait 2-3 seconds
3. **BOOM!** Update dialog appears!
4. Click "Download Update"
5. APK downloads
6. App installs automatically
7. Open new version - you're updated!

## 🔧 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

### Enable/Disable Auto-Update

**File:** `lib/services/app_update_service.dart` - Line 14

```dart
// Turn ON (default)
static const bool enableAutoUpdate = true;

// Turn OFF (disable feature)
static const bool enableAutoUpdate = false;
```

### Optional vs Mandatory Updates

**File:** `version.json`

```json
{
  "mandatory": true   // User MUST update (can't close dialog)
}
```

or

```json
{
  "mandatory": false  // User can choose (add "Remind Later" button)
}
```

**Note:** Currently set to mandatory (everyone stays on same version).

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Packages won't install

**Error:** "version solving failed"

**Solution:**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Problem: Update not detected

**Checklist:**
- [ ] GitHub repository is public
- [ ] version.json is on `main` branch
- [ ] Replaced `YOUR_USERNAME` in code
- [ ] versionCode is higher than current app
- [ ] Waited 2-3 seconds after opening app

### Problem: "Target of URI doesn't exist"

**Cause:** Haven't run `flutter pub get` yet

**Solution:**
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Problem: APK download fails

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Release is published (not draft)
- [ ] APK is uploaded to release
- [ ] Download URL in version.json is correct
- [ ] Internet connection is working

### Problem: Installation blocked

**Cause:** Android security settings

**Solution:**
- Settings → Apps → Special access → Install unknown apps
- Enable for your browser/file manager

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Tip #1: Version Numbering

Use semantic versioning:
- `1.0.0` → `1.0.1` - Bug fixes
- `1.0.0` → `1.1.0` - New features
- `1.0.0` → `2.0.0` - Major changes

### Tip #2: Changelogs

Write clear, user-friendly changelogs:

**Good:**
```json
"changelog": [
  "✨ Added book search feature",
  "🐛 Fixed QR scanner crash",
  "⚡ Made app 2x faster"
]
```

**Bad:**
```json
"changelog": [
  "Updated dependencies",
  "Refactored code",
  "Bug fixes"
]
```

### Tip #3: Test First

Always test updates on a personal device before releasing to all users!

### Tip #4: Backup APKs

Keep all release APKs backed up locally in case you need to rollback.

### Tip #5: Gradual Rollout

For major updates, consider:
1. Release to small group (10 users)
2. Wait 24 hours
3. If stable, release to everyone
